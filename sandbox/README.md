In this directory you can find simple page(index.html), which helps you to create new algorthm on graph on JavaScript. You don't need setuping webserver/php and other environment component. You can simple open index.html in browser and it should work. Also you find here algorithm sample (NewAlgorithm.js).

# Algorithm creating

Usualy algorithm is placed on js file. You can look sample NewAlgorithm.js, which search neighbors of vertex.

As other examples you can look some of our algorithms in /script/plugins. Not all of them are just JS algorthms, some of them use cgi binary component.
