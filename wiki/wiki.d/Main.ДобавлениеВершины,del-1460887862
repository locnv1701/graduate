text=My ex & I were close, then we had a bad break up. A month has gone by & we still see each other on a daily basis but don't talk b/c we don't want to make it awkward for our%3ca href="http://skujtiw.com"> mauutl%3c/a> friends by arguing. So we haven't had any contact & I've moved on but in the past 2 weeks I have dreamed about him 11 times.& the dreams are about him missing me, us getting back together, or me missing him.  Why do I keep dreaming about him? Does this mean he misses me?

I have told friends and I am seeing a psychologist. I just really want their support, but if I say I have anxiety they will demand to know about what. I am planning to be ambiguous about it, but the amount of worry I go through can't be explained by just saying worrying about stuff. I also don't know if I should lie initially and then tell them the real story. What do you think is the best way to approach this?%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
