text=My ex & I were close, then we had a bad break up. A month has gone by & we still see each other on a daily basis but don't talk b/c we don't want to make it awkward for our %3ca href="http://qogmxlwxo.com">mutaul%3c/a> friends by arguing. So we haven't had any contact & I've moved on but in the past 2 weeks I have dreamed about him 11 times.& the dreams are about him missing me, us getting back together, or me missing him.  Why do I keep dreaming about him? Does this mean he misses me?
