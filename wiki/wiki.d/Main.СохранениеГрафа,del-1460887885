text=Today my boyfriend of three years and i were %3ca href="http://zqergisjy.com">jonikg%3c/a> around and he took my keys so i grabbed his phone and started looking around when i went into pictures i found about a dozen nude pictures of girls, i got upset and he started saying it was porn and nothing else, they looked like random girls taking nudes in the mirror. I don't know what to do, we were planning on moving in together in a few months. What does this mean? Should I leave him?
