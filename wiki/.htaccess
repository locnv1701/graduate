# Root means that we want the wiki homepage
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/$
# Does the file exist?
# Change 'Main.HomePage' here if you're using a different page
RewriteCond /wiki/htmlcache/Main.HomePage.html -f
# If so, serve it.
# Change 'Main.HomePage' here if you're using a different page
RewriteRule ^$ htmlcache/Main.HomePage.html [L]

# No . or / in the URL means that we want the group main page
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/([^./?]+)[./]?$
# Does the file exist?
# Change '%1.%1' here if you're using a different group main page format
RewriteCond /wiki/htmlcache/%1.%1.html -f
# If so, serve it.

# Does the file exist?
RewriteCond /wiki/htmlcache/%1.%2.html -f
# If so, serve it.

# Cache misses and anything that doesn't fit the above goes to pmwiki.php
